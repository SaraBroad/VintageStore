At ZANA we believe in wearing pieces that make us feel like we are the heroines in the novel of our lives. In an effort to honor the green initiative many of our pieces have been refurbished. The ideal ZANA woman is an individual, she believes in simplicity and elegance, and does her part to preserve this gorgeous earth we call our home. She believes in the power of her own individuality and chooses to sheath herself in pieces that only highlight that.</p> 
               <br/>
               <p>Here at ZANA we are fully committed to the principles of green living. With the motto of everything old becomes new again firmly in our psyche, we want to breathe the same life into the skirt that’s been sitting in your closet that you haven’t seen since the late 80’s.
