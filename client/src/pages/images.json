   "Description": "This vintage gem came to us from suburban Philadelphia looking almost like a prarie dress. It's sleeves were long, the skirt came down to the ankles and there was originally a black panel behind the bow on the back. Regardless, the potential was evident. After shortening the hem, sleeves and removing that panel to allow that beautiful bow detail to shine, this dress became a LBD treasure that works on any occasion.",
