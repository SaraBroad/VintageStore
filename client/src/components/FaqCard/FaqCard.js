                <p>We know that ordering things online can be a gamble since you canâ€™t touch the items or try anything on, and because of that we try our best to be very return-friendly. However, as in life, there are certain rules that must be followed so that we can help you out!
                <li>Any items you purchased must be returned within 30 days of shipping and all items are only eligible for store credit issued in the form of a gift card.</li>
                <li>Returned items must remain un-washed and unworn.</li>
                <li>Anything purchased with any form of personalization is a FINAL SALE and is not eligible for return.</li>
                <li>Anything purchased at a discounted price is a FINAL SALE and is not eligible for return.</li>
