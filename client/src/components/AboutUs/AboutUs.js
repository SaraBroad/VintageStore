    <h1>About</h1>

        <p><img src="./public/images/about.jpg" align="left"/>I remember when I first discovered thrifting and vintage shopping. I was 10 years old, living in the third apartment my parents had moved us to after moving to the United States 4 years prior. At this point, I was already a weird kid, obsessed with classic movies, Katherine Hepburn, Audrey, Rosalind Russell, Grace Kelly and everything they wore in their movies. My family and I lived a quintessential new immigrant’s existence back then. We did most of our shopping at department store sales(Strawbridge’s Basement Sales, anyone?) because that’s where we were told you go to shop. And every time, I outgrew my clothes and needed a shopping trip, my mom would arm me with, you have a “$25” budget to buy all the items you need. Needless to say, I was never satisfied. Even on those rare occasions when the budget would be larger(Hello, birthdays!), I still never really fell in love with anything I’d find. I still looked just like everyone else. So when we moved to the apartment on Frankford and I discovered the thrift store down the street, I realized I had opened the doors to a whole new world.</p>
        <br/>
        <p> I can still remember my first “questionable” purchase. A pair of $3 seersucker shorts with brown leather suspenders that must have belonged to some little boy in the 50s and that my mom thought I was nuts for wanting. But, want them I did. And I wore them with my blue spice world t-shirt and platform sneaks and felt like the coolest human being on earth. Now, although most of my classmates would not have nominated me ‘best dressed’ in those days, I knew that I was killing the fashun game.</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Thus began my love affair with vintage clothing and honing my individuality. Over the years, I accrued a wide selection of priceless gems and over time, I learned to identify pieces that I could turn INTO priceless gems. With my patient momma’s help, I learned how to alter and modify pieces to make them more current or simply to make them work for me.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>The beauty of these clothes is that each piece transports you into your own romantic fairytale. You can be Audrey on the back of the Vespa in the streets of Paris, or journalist Rosalind in the busy newsroom or the independent katherine hepburn in woman of the year.”. I truly love each and every item. I’m so excited to share my treasures with you, I hope they bring you as much joy and excitement as owning and sourcing them has brought me!</p>
