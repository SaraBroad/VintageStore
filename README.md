# VintageStore

Deployed: https://secure-thicket-86420.herokuapp.com/

This is the website for our final project - a vintage store - created by developers Addie Johnson, Drita Dhami, and Sara Broad. This is a React app with routes to several different pages that include features such as an all items page, a cart, a privacy policy, and return policy. The app utilizes MySQL, with connections made through the Sequelize ORM, to store and retrieve information that the customers and business owners need to interact with our site. We relief heavily on Github for collaboration. There are more features we would like to add!
